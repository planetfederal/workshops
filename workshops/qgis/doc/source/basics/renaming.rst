Renaming
========

As a final step, let's change the names of our layers to something more descriptive.

#. Right click the **Dissolved** layer and click :guilabel:`Rename`.

#. Change the name to :kbd:`Antelope herd units`.

#. Change the name of **surfgeol_500k** to :kbd:`Surficial geology`.

#. Change the name of **dem_90m** to :kbd:`Digital elevation model`.

#. Change the name of **gaplndcov_WY** to :kbd:`Land cover`.

.. note:: For analysis purposes, we will need a large amount of data added to our project; however, it is not always necessary to render each of the layers in QGIS. By clicking the check box next to each layer, we can turn of rendering to make QGIS function quicker. You may want to disable the **Digital elevation model** and **Surficial geology** layers in your project.
