QGIS projects
=============

Our first step will be to launch QGIS and create a new project file that we will use throughout this workshop.

#. Click :menuselection:`Start --> All Programs --> OpenGeo Suite --> QGIS`.

#. Wait a few moments while QGIS launches.

#. When QGIS has loaded, you will be presented with a tips dialog and an empty project.

      QGIS main screen

#. We will be spending some time getting used to the QGIS interface, but one thing you should notice right away is the :guilabel:`Processing Toolbox` on the right-hand side of the screen.

#. If you don't see the toolbox or you close it, it can be opened again by clicking :menuselection:`Processing --> Toolbox` in the menu.

#. Although we haven't started working with any data yet, we can save our project file now by clicking :menuselection:`Project --> Save`. Give the file the name ``antelopes.qgs`` and save it in the ``workshop`` directory that we created earlier.

#. QGIS projects contain references to the data we are working with, how the data is displayed and other configuration options. If you want to see some of these options, you can open the project settings by clicking :menuselection:`Project --> Properties`.

   .. note:: On some platforms, such as Linux, the project settings can be found at :menuselection:`Settings --> Project Properties`.

#. Give your project a new title, :kbd:`Antelope range analysis`, and save it again.
