Groups
======

To help organise the data we have been adding to our layer list, we can use QGIS's grouping feature.

#. Right click in an empty area in the layer list.

#. Select :guilabel:`Add Group`.

      Adding a layer group

#. Give the new group the name :kbd:`Data`.

#. By dragging and dropping, move the following layers into the **Data** group: **Area of interest**, **Digital elevation model**, **Antelope herd units**, **Land cover**, **Seasonal ranges** and **Surficial geology** (vector). Since the **Surificial geology (raster)** is a temporary file we'll leave it outside of the **Data** group.

#. Create a new group called **Reference** and move the reference table into it.

#. Create a new group called **Results** and a sub-group called **Surficial geology** and move the remaining **Surficial geology (baseline)** table into it.
