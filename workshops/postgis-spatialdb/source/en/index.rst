Spatial Database Tips and Tricks Workshop
=========================================

Mapping APIs are great for data display and capture, but how do you build 
applications that allow query and geoprocessing of spatial data without 
becoming a Java or C++ programming guru? How about using the power of SQL, 
the standard database query language, and the spatial extensions provided 
by SQL Server, Oracle Spatial and PostGIS.
