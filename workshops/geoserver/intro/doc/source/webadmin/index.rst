GeoServer web interface
=======================

GeoServer includes a web-based administration interface. Most GeoServer configuration can be done through this interface, without the need to edit configuration files by hand or use an API.

This section will give a brief overview to the web interface, including loading data to be published. Subsequent sections will use the web interface in greater detail.
